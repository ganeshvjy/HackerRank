//
This is an introductory challenge. The purpose of this challenge is to give you a working I/O template in your 
preferred language. It includes scanning 2 integers from STDIN, calling a function, returning a value, and printing 
it to STDOUT.

The task is to scan two numbers from STDIN, and print the sum A+B on STDOUT. The code has already been provided for 
most of the popular languages. This is primarily for you to read and inspect how the IO is handled.

Note: The code has been saved in a template, which you can submit if you want. Or, you may try rewriting it and 
building it up from scratch.
//

#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;


int solveMeFirst(int a, int b) {
  return a+b;
}
int main() {
  int num1, num2;
  int sum;
  cin>>num1>>num2;
  sum = solveMeFirst(num1,num2);
  cout<<sum;
  return 0;
}
